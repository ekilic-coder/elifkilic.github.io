      <h2>Heat Stress and Vulnerability</h2>
      <p>
        Extreme heat is a “silent threat” because its impacts often go unnoticed until
        communities experience spikes in dehydration, heat stroke, kidney disease
        and other illnesses【95984291269869†L110-L118】. Central America and Mexico are
        particularly susceptible because many people live in poorly planned urban
        areas without access to clean water and sanitation and because high poverty
        levels limit adaptation options【95984291269869†L121-L128】.
        Vulnerable groups include children, pregnant women, older adults, people with
        disabilities and outdoor workers【109903180744806†L256-L262】. The following
        sections summarise how heat stress affects each country in the region.

      <section id="belize">
        <h3>Belize</h3>
        <p>
          The ThinkHazard database classifies Belize’s extreme heat hazard as high,
          meaning prolonged exposure to dangerous temperatures is expected at least
          once in the next five years【518284492743674†L34-L41】. Heat affects a
          variety of sectors—including health, energy, transport and agriculture—and
          disproportionately impacts urban populations and outdoor workers【518284492743674†L65-L70】.
          In 2024 temperatures above 100 °F triggered forest fires, prompting the
          Belize Red Cross to provide hygiene kits and cash assistance【109903180744806†L225-L245】.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="guatemala">
        <h3>Guatemala</h3>
        <p>
          Guatemala is one of the Central American countries with the highest risk of
          heat-related impacts【95984291269869†L145-L147】. Heat waves and drought have
          contributed to a 622 % increase in dengue cases between early 2023 and
          early 2024【109903180744806†L225-L245】. The extreme heat hazard is classified as
          high【404623699824588†L33-L40】, and vulnerability is amplified by rapid
          urbanisation, limited infrastructure and high poverty【95984291269869†L121-L128】.
          Protecting children, older adults and outdoor workers is therefore a
          national priority【109903180744806†L256-L262】.
        </p>

      <section id="honduras">
        <h3>Honduras</h3>
        <p>
          Like Guatemala, Honduras faces a high extreme heat hazard【706382942679153†L33-L39】.
          The country recorded a 580 % increase in dengue cases in early 2024 compared
          with the previous year due to a combination of heat and drought【109903180744806†L225-L245】.
          High poverty, limited access to water and health services, and widespread
          outdoor work make the population particularly vulnerable【95984291269869†L121-L128】.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="el-salvador">
        <h3>El Salvador</h3>
        <p>
          El Salvador is listed alongside Guatemala as having the highest heat risk in
          Central America【95984291269869†L145-L147】. Although detailed statistics are
          scarce, the country shares many of the same vulnerabilities: high
          urbanisation, inadequate infrastructure and limited health care capacity
          increase susceptibility to heat-related illness【95984291269869†L121-L128】.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="nicaragua">
        <h3>Nicaragua</h3>
        <p>
          Nicaragua does not have a publicly available hazard classification but
          experiences the same regional challenges: poor housing, lack of potable
          water and high poverty leave many communities exposed to extreme heat and
          humidity【95984291269869†L121-L128】. Evidence on heat-related health impacts
          remains limited, yet studies suggest that heat waves can exacerbate
          dehydration, heat stroke and other illnesses【95984291269869†L110-L118】.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="costa-rica">
        <h3>Costa Rica</h3>
        <p>
          Costa Rica is generally considered less vulnerable due to stronger
          institutions, but rising temperatures and humidity still pose risks to
          outdoor workers and urban residents. As in the rest of the region,
          vulnerable groups include children, pregnant women and older adults【109903180744806†L256-L262】.
          More research is needed to quantify how climate change will affect
          heat-related illnesses in the coming decades【95984291269869†L152-L158】.

      <section id="panama">
        <h3>Panama</h3>
        <p>
          Limited hazard data exist for Panama, but the country is experiencing
          increasingly hot summers and humidity. With large urban centres on both
          coasts and a booming service economy, heat exposure will impact workers in
          construction, tourism and logistics. Ensuring access to cooling and
          hydration for vulnerable populations will be critical【95984291269869†L121-L128】.
        </p>

      <section id="mexico">
        <h3>Mexico</h3>
        <p>
          Mexico has been hit by a multiyear drought since the winter of
          2022–2023. By May 2024 nearly 76 % of the country was experiencing drought,
          making it the most widespread drought since 2011【843139461447320†L116-L134】.
          The drought has intensified heat waves, causing water scarcity and
          agricultural losses; central and southern Mexico—home to major
          population centres—have been particularly affected【843139461447320†L116-L134】.
          Vulnerable populations include outdoor workers, farmers and those without
          air conditioning or access to reliable water sources【109903180744806†L256-L262】.

      <h3>How to Publish Your Writing and Graphs</h3>
      <p>
        You can extend this page by adding new sections for additional topics or by
        updating existing text. To document your findings graphically, upload
        figures into the <code>assets/graphs</code> folder with descriptive file
        names (for example <code>2025-08-15-heat-index-map.png</code>). Then insert
        the graph in the relevant section using an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, e.g.:
      </p>
      <pre><code>&lt;img src="assets/graphs/2025-08-15-heat-index-map.png" alt="Heat index map for 15 Aug 2025" /&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        Commit the new file and updated HTML to your repository. Once pushed to
        GitHub, your graph will automatically appear on the published website. This
        simple workflow—upload the image, reference it in HTML and push your
        changes—ensures your work is time-stamped and attributable to you.
